### DeepGWAS to Enhance GWAS Signals for Neuropsychiatric Disorders via Deep Neural Network 

In this work, we developed a 14-layer deep neural network, DeepGWAS, to enhance GWAS signals by leveraging GWAS summary statistics (p-value, odds ratio, minor allele frequency, linkage disequilibrium score), as well as brain related functional genomic and epigenomic information (FIRE, super FIRE, open chromatin, eQTL). 

DeepGWAS is maintained by Jia Wen [jia_wen@med.unc.edu] and Gang Li [gangliuw@uw.edu].
