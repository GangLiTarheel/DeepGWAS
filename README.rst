# DeepGWAS
=======================================

*DeepGWAS* to Enhance GWAS Signals for Neuropsychiatric Disorders via Deep Neural Network 
In this work, we developed a 14-layer deep neural network, DeepGWAS, to enhance GWAS signals by leveraging GWAS summary statistics (p-value, odds ratio, minor allele frequency, linkage disequilibrium score), as well as brain related functional genomic and epigenomic information (FIRE, super FIRE, open chromatin, eQTL).
